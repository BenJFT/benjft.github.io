Hi, I'm Benedict.

I'm a software developer working for Gold-Vision CRM.
Day to day I use .Net, C#, React, and Sql Server, and am part of the DevOps team in my current role.

I have a Bachelors degree in Computer Science and the first half of a degree in Theoretical Physics.
In my free time I like to play with all sorts of technologies, I'm especially fond of Go and Python, and enjoy working 
on all kinds of projects: from apps to simulations to bespoke and specialized tools.

When I'm not coding I'm probably in a field somewhere shooting my bow.
I've shot olympic style recurve since I was a kid, and am currently undergoing my level 1 coaching qualification.
I also shoot competitions individually and as part of the West Midlands county team.
In 2023 I won the West Midlands Senior Outdoor Championship, which I hope to defend this year.
