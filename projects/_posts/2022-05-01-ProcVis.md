## Motivation
Computer architecture is topic I have found interesting since I was first 
introduced to it.
Not all can say the same though.
Talking to many of my cohort, they found it unengaging or hard to relate to
anything they expected they would need to use.

When it came to choosing my final year project I decided that an interesting 
idea would be to see if a simple interactive tool that allowed users to engage
with the project would help these people find it more interesting
